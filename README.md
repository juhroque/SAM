## Clean Architecture and Domain Driven Design (DDD)

- This API is being built based on the [Clean Architecture with ASP.NET 6 course by Amichai Mantinband on Youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhM0V2N1GpY&list=PLzYkqgWkHPKBcDIP5gzLfASkQyTdy0t4k&index=1)
- I am uploading the course main notes that I'm doing while developing this API at the Docs/HowTo folder.
